.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS HTTPD
The httpd program is an HTTP daemon, serving version 1.0 of the HTTP protocol.
It is usually executed in response to an incoming call on TCP port 80, the HTTP port.
.PP
The httpd program supports only the GET and HEAD methods of the HTTP protocol.
The Content\-type (default application/octet\-stream) and Content\-encoding (default binary) of a file are determined by looking for suffixes of the file name in /http/logs/http.suff.
.PP
If the requested URI begins with /magic/, the httpd program loads the module associated with the remaining part of the URI.
