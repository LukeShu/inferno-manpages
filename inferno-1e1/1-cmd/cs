.SH NAME
cs \- start connection server daemon
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
lib/cs
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cs command creates a file named cs in the /net directory then spawns a daemon process also named cs.
Command cs then terminates while daemon cs continues execution, monitoring read and write requests to the /net/cs file.
Once the daemon process is running, application programs can write host names to /net/cs and read that same file to obtain the corresponding internet address.
The requests can also symbolically name a service (e.g.
$MAILSERVER) that the daemon resolves by reference to the /services/cs/db file.
.PP
The daemon process persists until explicitly terminated.
The interface file, /net/cs, persists until unmounted from /net.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
The cs command has no options or arguments.
