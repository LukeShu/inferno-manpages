.SH DESCRIPTION
The pwd command prints the path name of the current directory (synonymous to the \[aq]working\[aq] directory).
.PP
.SH CAVEAT
The pwd command does not guarantee to return the same path that was used to enter the directory.
The returned path may be another route through the name space to the same working directory.
This behavior arises when a combination of mounts or binds produces a graph in the file name space.
