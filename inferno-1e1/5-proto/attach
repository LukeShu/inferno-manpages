.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS THE NOP TRANSACTION
The nop request does nothing overt but may be used to synchronize the channel initially.
.PP
The tag should be notag (value 16rFFFF) for a nop message.
.PP
.SS THE ATTACH TRANSACTION
The attach message serves as a fresh introduction from a user on the client machine to a server.
The message identifies the user 
.I (uid)
and may select the file tree to access (
.I aname
).
.PP
As a result of the attach transaction, the client will have a connection to the root directory of the desired file tree, represented by 
.I fid
.
An error is returned if 
.I fid
is already in use.
The server\[aq]s idea of the root of the file tree is represented by the returned 
.I qid
.
.PP
.SH ENTRY POINTS
An attach transaction will be generated for kernel devices (see 
.I Inferno Devices
) when a system call evaluates a file name beginning with #.
A mount call (see 
.I bind
) generates an attach message to the remote file server.
When the kernel boots, an attach is made to the root device, 
.I root
, and then an 
.I attach
is made to the requested file server machine.
