.SH DESCRIPTION
Since the syntax #/ is illegal, this device can only be accessed directly by the kernel.
.PP
This device is set up by the kernel to be the root of the name space.
The names in the one\-level tree are mostly just place\-holders, to allow a place for binding other files.
The exception is /boot (not present in the emulation environment) which provides an executable Dis binary when read.
Native kernels load /boot when initializing the system.
Other files needed for bootstrap may also reside in this device.
