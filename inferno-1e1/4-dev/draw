.SH DESCRIPTION
The draw device serves a two\-level file system providing an interface to the graphics facilities of the system; the Limbo Draw module (see 
.I Limbo Draw Modules
) accesses the device to implement its functions.
.PP
Each client of the device connects by opening /dev/drawnew and reading back seven decimal numbers in the standard 12\-character format.
The seven values are:
.IP \[bu] 2
The connection number, 
.I n
.
.IP \[bu] 2
The image id of the display image (always zero).
.IP \[bu] 2
The ldepth of the display image.
.IP \[bu] 2
Four values (min.x, min.y, max.x, and max.y) that define the display image.
.RS 2

The client can then open the directory /dev/draw
.I n
/ (where 
.I n
is the connection number) to access the ctl, data, and refresh files associated with the connection.
