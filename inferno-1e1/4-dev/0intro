.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS PATHNAME RESOLUTION
An Inferno 
.I device
implements a file tree for client processes.
A file name beginning with a pound sign, such as #c, names the root of a file tree implemented by a particular 
.I kernel
device driver identified by the character after the pound sign.
Such names are usually bound to conventional locations in the name space.
For example, after
.IP
.EX
   sys\->bind(\[dq]#c\[dq], \[dq]/dev\[dq], sys\->MREPL)
.EE
.PP
an ls of /dev will list the files provided by the console device.
.PP
A kernel device driver is a 
.I server
in the sense of the Inferno File Protocol, Styx (see 
.I Inferno File Protocol, Styx
), but with the messages implemented by local rather than remote procedure calls.
Also, several of the messages (
.I Nop
, 
.I Flush
, and 
.I Error
) have no subroutine equivalents.
.PP
When a system call is passed a file name beginning with # it looks at the next character, and if that is a valid 
.I device
.I character
it performs an \[aq]attach\[aq] operation on the corresponding device to get a connection representing the root of that device\[aq]s file tree.
See 
.I attach
.
If there are any characters after the device character but before the next / or end of string, those characters are passed as parameter 
.I aname
to the attach.
.PP
Each kernel device has a conventional place at which to be bound to the name space.
The synopsis sections of the following pages includes a shell 
.I bind
command to put the device in the conventional place.
Most of these binds are done automatically by the system when it initializes.
