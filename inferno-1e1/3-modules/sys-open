.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS OPEN (FILE, OMODE)
The open function opens the 
.I file
for I/O and returns an associated file descriptor.
The 
.I omode
argument is one of

Sys\->OTRUNC
T}@T{
Truncate the file before opening it; this requires write permission even if 
.I omode
is Sys\->OREAD.

Sys\->ORCLOSE
T}@T{
Remove the file on closure.

The open function returns nil if the file does not exist or the user does not have permission to open it as requested (see 
.I stat
for a description of permissions).
.PP
.SS CREATE (FILE, OMODE, PERM)
The create function creates a new file 
.I or
prepares to rewrite an existing 
.I file
, opens it according to 
.I omode
(as described for open), and returns an associated file descriptor.
.PP
If the file is new, the owner is set to the 
.I user
.I id
of the creating process group, the group to that of the containing directory, and the permissions to perm 
.I AND\[aq]ed
with the permissions of the containing directory.
See 
.I The create Transaction
section of 
.I open
.
.PP
If the file already exists, it is truncated to 0 length, and the permissions, owner, and group remain unchanged.
.PP
The created file will be a directory if the Sys\->CHDIR bit is set in 
.I omode
.
.PP
The create function returns nil if the path up to the last element of file 
.I cannot
be evaluated, if the user does not have write permission in the final directory, or if the file already exists and does not permit the access defined by 
.I omode
.
.PP
If the file is new and the directory in which it is created is a union directory (see 
.I Limbo System Modules
) then the constituent directory where the file is created depends on the structure of the union: see 
.I bind
.
.PP
.SH CAVEAT
There is no explicit \[aq]close\[aq] routine; when the last reference to the file descriptor is released, the system closes the associated file.
.PP
For devices and network protocols where shutdown must be guaranteed, write a \[dq]hangup\[dq] message to the associated control file and use the return value of the write to verify closure.
For example, see 
.I ip
.
