Context: adt

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Context abstract data type encapsulates the data types and channels used by an interactive application.
A reference to the Context is passed as the first argument to an application when it begins execution:
.IP
.EX
include \[dq]draw.m\[dq]; 
Command: module 
{
     init:  fn(nil: ref Draw\->Context; nil: list of string);
};
.EE
.PP
Most programs do not create Contexts but rather inherit one from their parent, typically a shell or window system.
