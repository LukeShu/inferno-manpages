.SH DESCRIPTION
The Wmlib module provides routines for making and updating windows controlled by 
.I wm
.
.PP
.SS INIT ( )
The init function must be called once to initialize the internal state of wmlib.
.PP
.SS TITLEBAR (T, TITLE, BUTS)
The titlebar function creates a collection of widgets, rooted at.Wm_t, which can be packed in the Toplevel 
.I t
to create a managed title bar.
The title bar consists of a label, .Wm_t.title, and the buttons specified by the bit mask 
.I buts
.
The .Wm_t.title label is initialized with the string 
.I title
, and can be reconfigured to change the title of the window.
An exit button is always created in the title bar; the buttons defined by the constants Resize, Hide, Help, and OK are optional.
Most applications should use the buttons defined by the constant Appl, which is Resize|Hide.
.PP
A channel is returned by titlebar by which the application is informed of Tk events (See 
.I tk
).
Messages received on it should be processed by the application.
The messages that may arrive on the returned channel are:
.PP
.TS

the 
.I request

.I request
.
The supported requests are:
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l l.
T{
[dq]move\[dq] and \[dq]size\[dq]
T}@T{
The titlectl function communicates with wm to obtain new position (size) parameters and relays the new configuration to Tk.
T}
T{
[dq]exit\[dq]
T}@T{
The titlectl function terminates the current process and all members of its process group.
T}
T{
[dq]task\[dq]
T}@T{
The titlectl function unmaps the Toplevel, make an entry in the task bar, and suspend the current process.
Later, selecting the task bar entry will remap the Toplevel and allow the process to resume.

.PP
.SS GETFILENAME (SCREEN, PARENT, TITLE, PAT, DIR)
The getfilename function makes a dialog box for selecting a file.
It is displayed on screen near 
.I parent
.
The 
.I dir
argument gives the directory where the file search should begin.
Only files that match pattern pat 
.I are
displayed.
The rules for defining match patters are described on 
.I lib\-filepat
.
.PP
The returned string is the name of the selected file, or the empty string if no file was selected.
.PP
.SS GEOM (T)
The geom function returns a string with the coordinates for a child window.
.PP
