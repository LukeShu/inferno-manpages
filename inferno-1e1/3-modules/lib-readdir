.SH DESCRIPTION
The Readdir module reads the contents of the directory 
.I path
and sorts the resulting array according to 
.I sortkey
.
.PP
Each element in the returned array is a reference to one Dir element in the array formed by the dirread system call.
Readdir also returns the number of entries read, or \-1 on failure.
.PP
The sorting criteria for the returned array are based on 
.I sortkey
as follows:
