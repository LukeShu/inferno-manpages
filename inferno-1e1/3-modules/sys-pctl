pctl: fn(flags: int, movefd: list of ref FD): int;

.SH DESCRIPTION
A newly spawned Limbo process (also known as a thread) shares with its parent process a number of resources and properties, such as file name space, open file descriptors, current working directory, and so on.
The pctl function controls this sharing, allowing a process to gain a copy of a resource rather than to share it, to start with a null resource, and so on.
.PP
The set of processes sharing a property are called a group; for example the set of processes sharing a name space are called a name space group.
Each process is a member of a 
.I process
.I group
, typically the set of threads functioning as a single program.
All the members of a process group may be terminated at once using the \[dq]killgrp\[dq] control message in the 
.I prog
device.
.PP
A call to pctl affects the calling process and, indirectly according to 
.I flags
, any other processes sharing properties with it.
The 
.I flags
to pctl are:
.PP

l l.
T{
NEWFD
T}@T{
Place the process in a new file descriptor group.
By default, no files will be open for I/O after this pctl.
However, any file descriptor passed in the 
.I movefd
parameter will be preserved across the call.
T}
T{
FORKFD
T}@T{
Place the process in a new file descriptor group containing a copy of the current set of file descriptors.
After this call, changes the process makes to its set of open file descriptors will not be visible to other processes.
T}
T{
NEWNS
T}@T{
Place the process in a new file name space group containing only a root directory, /, made from an attach to 
.I root
.
The current directory is unaffected by this call.
No files other than / will be accessible by name after this pctl; bind and mount calls will be necessary to build a new name space.
T}
T{
FORKNS
T}@T{
Place the process in a new file name space group containing a copy of the current name space.
After this call, changes the process makes to its name space, including chdir calls, will not affect other processes.
T}
T{
NEWPGRP
T}@T{
Establish a new process group with a group id equal to that of the pid of the calling process.

The return value of pctl is the numerical process id of the calling process, which can be used for example to access its 
.I prog
files.

.SH NOTE
Programs run synchronously from the shell share its file name space, so programs like bind and mount and cd can affect the shell\[aq]s environment.
Programs that need a private space should call this system call with the FORKNS option.
