include \[dq]sys.m\[dq];
sys:= load Sys Sys\->PATH;
fstat:  fn(fd: ref FD)          : (int, Dir);
fwstat: fn(fd: ref FD;  d: Dir) : int;
stat:   fn(name: string)        : (int, Dir);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS STAT (NAME, D) AND FSTAT (FD, D)
Given a file\[aq]s 
.I name
, or an open file descriptor 
.I fd
, these routines return information about the file into the Dir member of the returned tuple.
The int member will be zero for success and \-1 for failure.
.PP
.SS WSTAT (NAME, D) AND FWSTAT (FD, D)
The wstat and fwstat functions apply the file attributes of 
.I d
to the file.
Only certain attributes can be modified.
See section the section titled 
.I Modifying File Attributes
below.
Both functions return zero for success and \-1 for failure.
.PP
.SS THE DIR ABSTRACT DATA TYPE
File status is managed via the Dir abstract data type:

Qid: adt 
{   
    path:  int;   
    vers:  int; 
}; 

Dir: adt 
{   
    name:  string;   
    uid:  string;   
    gid:  string;   
    qid:  Qid;   
    mode:  int;   
    atime: int;   
    mtime: int;   
    length: int;   
    dtype: int;   
    dev:  int;

.SH NOTES
The following behaviors apply when Inferno is hosted on Windows\-based systems.
.PP
.SS FAT FILE SYSTEM (WIN95 AND WINDOWS\-NT)
The values of uid and gid are Everyone.
.PP
Files and directories always have read and execute permission.
They cannot be changed.
Files without write permission cannot be removed.
.PP
.SS NTFS FILE SYSTEM (WINDOWS\-NT)
Permissions for read, write, and execute operate as described above.
.PP
The uid attribute is supported.
.PP
The gid attribute is interpreted always to mean the special group InfernoGroup, even if the underlying Windows system maintains other groups for the file.
Special group Everyone is used to represent \[aq]other\[aq] for permissions.
