.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS DIRREAD (FD, DIR)
The dirread function reads the contents of the directory pointed to by the open file descriptor 
.I fd
, filling in the array 
.I dir
with one Dir structure for each element.
These Dir structures are equivalent to the result of a stat call on each file in the directory.
See 
.I stat
for a description of stat and Dir.
.PP
A successful dirread returns the number of entries read, up to the length of array 
.I dir
; the number returned may be less than the number requested.
The file offset is advanced by the number of bytes actually read.
A return of 0 indicates the end of the directory.
.PP
Seeks (see 
.I seek
) are not allowed on directories.
