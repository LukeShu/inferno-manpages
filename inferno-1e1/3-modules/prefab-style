.SH DESCRIPTION
The Style type collects the font and color information for an application or a set of items within an application.
Except when using the layout routines (see 
.I compound
and 
.I element
), the members of a Style are the only way to control the appearance of Prefab items.
Note that although the \[aq]color\[aq] members in practice often refer to a literal color (a single replicated pixel of color), they can be any image.
.PP
Styles are allocated by regular Limbo definitions; there is no allocation function.
All the members of a Style must be defined.
Although it will not cause errors to modify the members of a Style after it has been created and passed to a Prefab routine, the results may be unpredictable.
