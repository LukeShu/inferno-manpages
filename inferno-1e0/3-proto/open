.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS THE OPEN TRANSACTION
The 
.I open
request asks the file server to check permissions and prepare a fid for I/O with subsequent 
.I read
and 
.I write
messages.
.PP
The 
.I mode
field expresses the type of I/O requested and is checked against the permissions for the file.
Additional options can also be requested.
The allowed values are shown below.
If other bits are set in 
.I mode
they will be ignored.

It is illegal to write a directory, truncate it, or attempt to remove it on close.
.PP
All these permissions are checked at the time of the 
.I open
request; any subsequent changes to the permissions of files do not affect the ability to read, write, or remove an open file.
.PP
It is an error if the fid is already the product of a successful 
.I open
or 
.I create
message.
.PP
.SS THE CREATE TRANSACTION
The 
.I create
request asks the file server to create a new file with the 
.I name
supplied, in the directory (
.I dir
) represented by 
.I fid
.
This request and requires write permission in the directory.
The owner of the file is the implied user id of the request and the group of the file is the same as 
.I dir
.
.PP
The permissions of the newly created file depend on the permissions of the enclosing directory (
.I dir.perm
) and the 
.I perm
value of the request.
.PP
For non\-directories, the formula is
.IP
.EX
   (perm&(\[ti]8r777|8r111)) | (dir.perm&perm&8r666) 
.EE
.PP
For directories, the formula is
.IP
.EX
   (perm&\[ti]8r777) | (dir.perm&perm&8r777)
.EE
.PP
This means, for example, that if the 
.I create
allows read permission to others, but the containing directory does not, then the created file will not allow others to read the file.
.PP
Finally, the newly created file is opened according to 
.I mode
, and 
.I fid
will represent the newly opened file.
The 
.I mode
is not checked against the permissions in 
.I perm
.
.PP
The 
.I qid
for the new file is returned with the 
.I create
reply message.
.PP
Directories are created by setting the 
.I CHDIR
bit (16r80000000) in the 
.I perm
.
.PP
The names 
.I \[aq].\[aq]
and 
.I \[aq]..\[aq]
are special.
It is illegal to create files with these names.
.PP
It is an error if the fid is already the product of a successful 
.I open
or 
.I create
message.
.PP
An attempt to 
.I create
a file in a directory where the given 
.I name
already exists will be rejected.
The 
.B create
system call uses 
.I open
with truncation.
(see 
.I 
open, create \- open/create a file for reading or writing
.I  in Chapter 8
.I )

.PP
The algorithm used by the 
.B create
system call is:
.IP "1." 3
Walk to the directory to contain the file.
If that fails, return an error.
.IP "2." 3
Walk to the specified file.
If the 
.I walk
succeeds, send a request to 
.I open
(with the truncate option) the file and return the result, successful or not.
.IP "3." 3
If the 
.I walk
fails, send a 
.I create
message.
If that fails, it may be because the file was created by another process after the previous 
.I walk
failed, so (once) try the 
.I walk
and 
.I open
(with the truncate option) again.
For the behavior of 
.I create
on a union directory, (See 
.I bind, mount, unmount \- change file name space
in Chapter 8).
.PP
.SH ENTRY POINTS
The 
.B open
and 
.B create
calls both generate 
.I open
messages; only the 
.B create
call generates a 
.I create
message.
