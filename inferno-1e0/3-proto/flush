.SH DESCRIPTION
When the response to a request is no longer needed, such as when a user interrupts a process doing a 
.B read
, a 
.I Tflush
request is sent to the server to purge the pending response.
The message being flushed is identified by 
.I oldtag
.
The semantics of flush depend on messages arriving in order.
.PP
The server must answer the flush message immediately.
If it recognizes 
.I oldtag
as the tag of a pending transaction, it should abort any pending response and discard that tag.
In either case, it should respond with an 
.I Rflush
echoing the 
.I tag
(not 
.I oldtag
) of the 
.I Tflush
message.
The response to a 
.I Tflush
message should never be an 
.I Rerror
message.
.PP
When the client sends the 
.I Tflush
, it should disregard all messages received with tag 
.I oldtag
until the corresponding 
.I Rflush
is received, at which point 
.I oldtag
may be recycled for subsequent messages.
.PP
The following exceptional conditions are handled correctly by the above specification:
.IP \[bu] 2
sending multiple flushes for a single tag
.IP \[bu] 2
flushing a 
.I Tflush

.IP \[bu] 2
flushing an invalid tag
