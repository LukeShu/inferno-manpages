.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I remove
request asks the file server both to remove the file represented by 
.I fid
and to clunk the 
.I fid
.
The 
.I fid
is clunked even if the remove fails.
.PP
This request fails if the client does not have write permission in the parent directory.
.PP
It is correct to consider 
.I remove
to be a clunk with the side effect of removing the file if permissions allow.
.PP
.SH ENTRY POINTS

.I remove
messages are generated by the 
.B remove
system call (see 
.I remove \- remove a file
