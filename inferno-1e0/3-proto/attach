.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I attach
message serves as a fresh introduction from a user on the client machine to a server.
The message identifies the user 
.I (uid)
and may select the file tree to access (
.I aname
).
.PP
As a result of the 
.I attach
transaction, the client will have a connection to the root directory of the desired file tree, represented by 
.I fid
.
An error is returned if 
.I fid
is already in use.
The server\[aq]s idea of the root of the file tree is represented by the returned 
.I qid
.
.PP
The 
.I nop
request does nothing overt but may be used to synchronize the channel initially.
.PP
The 
.I tag
should be 
.I notag
(value 16rFFFF) for a 
.I nop
message.

.SH ENTRY POINTS
An 
.I attach
transaction will be generated for kernel devices (see 
.I Inferno Devices
in Chapter 2) when a system call evaluates a file name beginning with #.
A 
.B mount
call (see 
.I bind, mount, unmount \- change file name space
in Chapter 8) generates an 
.I attach
message to the remote file server.
When the kernel boots, an 
.I attach
is made to the root device, 
.I root
, and then an 
.I attach
is made to the requested file server machine.
