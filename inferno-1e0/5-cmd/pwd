.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I pwd
command prints the path name of the current directory (also called the \[aq]working\[aq] directory).
.PP
.SH CAVEAT
The 
.I pwd
command does not guarantee to return the same path that was used to enter the directory.
The returned path may be another route through the name space to the same working directory.
This behavior arises when a combination of mounts or binds produces a graph in the file name space.
