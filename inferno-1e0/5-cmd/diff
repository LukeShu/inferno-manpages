.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I diff
command tells what lines must be changed in two files to bring them into agreement.

If one file is a directory
T}@T{
then a file in that directory with a basename the same as that of the other file is used
T}
T{
If both files are directories
T}@T{
similarly named files in the two directories are compared by the method of 
.I diff
for text files and cmp otherwise
T}
T{
If more than two file names are given
T}@T{
then each argument is compared to the last argument as above

The normal output contains lines of these forms:
.IP \[bu] 2
n1 a n3, n4
.IP \[bu] 2
n1, n2 d n3
.IP \[bu] 2
n1, n2 c n3, n4
.RS 2

These lines resemble commands of the Unix system editor 
.I ed
to convert 
.I file1
into 
.I file2
.
The numbers after the letters pertain to 
.I file2
.
In fact, by exchanging 
.I \[aq]a\[aq]
for 
.I \[aq]d\[aq]
and reading backward, it can be determined how to convert 
.I file2
into 
.I file1
.
As in 
.I ed
, identical pairs where 
.I n1
= 
.I n2
or 
.I n3
= 
.I n4
are abbreviated as a single number.
.PP
Following each of these lines are the lines that are affected in the first file flagged by \[aq]<\[aq], then all the lines that are affected in the second file flagged by \[aq]>\[aq].
.PP
Except in rare circumstances, 
.I diff
finds a smallest sufficient set of file differences.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TS
tab(@);
l l.
T{
-e
T}@T{
The 
.I \-e
option produces a script of 
.I a,
.I c
and 
.I d
.I commands
for the Unix system editor 
.I ed
, which will recreate 
.I file2
from 
.I file1
.
T}
T{
-f
T}@T{
The 
.I \-f
option produces a similar script, not useful with ed, in the opposite order.
It may, however, be useful as input to a stream\-oriented post\-processor.
T}
T{
-b
T}@T{
The 
.I \-b
option causes trailing blanks (spaces and tabs) to be ignored and other strings of blanks to compare equal.
T}
T{
-w
T}@T{
The 
.I \-w
option causes all white space to be removed from input lines before applying the difference algorithm.
T}
T{
-r
T}@T{
The \-r option causes 
.I diff
to process similarly named subdirectories recursively.

.SH CAVEAT
Editing scripts produced under the 
.I \-e
or 
.I \-f
option are naive about creating lines consisting of a single 
.I \[aq].\[aq]
.
When running 
.I diff
on directories, the notion of what is a text file is open to debate.
