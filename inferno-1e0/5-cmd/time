.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I time
command is a front end to the execution of the 
.I cmd
and arguments that appear on the command line.
On completion of the subject program (
.I cmd
), 
.I time
prints to standard error a line with the load, real time, and total times (in seconds) for the program.
.PP
The 
.I time
command follows the same rules as the shell for converting 
.I cmd
to the pathname of an executable module.
.PP
The load time displayed is just the value for 
.I time
to load 
.I cmd
.
Any loads performed by 
.I cmd
are included in the reported real time.
.PP
The 
.I time
command is designed to act on a single command, not a command pipeline.
If statistics on a pipeline are needed, the pipeline should be encapsulated into a separate script for timing.
For example,
.IP
.EX
    echo \[aq]ls | grep sh\[aq] > pipeline;  time sh pipeline
.EE
.PP
In the example above , the load value returned by 
.I time
is for the loading of 
.I sh
, not the subsidiary commands of the pipeline.
