.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I mv
command can be used in several ways.
.PP
If there are two arguments of the same type (directories or files) then 
.I mv
will rename the 
.I fromfile
to 
.I tofile
.
.PP
For files, a previously file named 
.I tofile
will be (silently) removed.
This requires write permission for the current directory.
Write permission is not needed for 
.I tofile
.
.PP
For directories, a previously existing directory named 
.I todir
will be (silently) removed if empty, and the 
.I mv
operation will fail.
.PP
If the last argument is a directory, the earlier arguments (all files) will be moved into that directory.
Any previously existing files of the same name will be overwritten.
.PP
.SH CAVEATS
Directories cannot be renamed or moved into other directories.
