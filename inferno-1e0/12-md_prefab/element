.SH DESCRIPTION

.I Elements
are the building blocks of the ITV toolkit.
They represent and display text and pictures that can be grouped in arbitrary two\-dimensional menus to be walked by an infrared remote control.

.I Elements
are packaged within 
.I Compounds
for display (see 
.I compound \- windows for ITV toolkit
).
.PP
.SS ENVIRON
This specifies the element\[aq]s environment.
.PP
.SS IMAGE
If the element needs an Image 
.I object
(see 
.I kind
in this section), this member specifies it.
.PP
.SS KIND
The Prefab module defines six 
.I Element
varieties, each labeled by a defined constant in the kind member.
.PP
.SS EICON
An image.
.PP
.SS EHORIZONTAL
A horizontal list of elements.
.PP
.SS ESEPARATOR
An Image object, like an 
.I EIcon
, but intended to fill space in a list, rather than to serve as an element of the list.
Separators are ignored when selecting or highlighting list elements.
.PP
.SS ETEXT
A single line of text.
Text for this element will be drawn with 
.I Style.textfont
and 
.I Style.textcolor
.
.PP
.SS ETITLE
A single line of text, usually giving the title of a Compound object.

.I Text
for this element will be drawn with 
.I Style.titlefont
and 
.I Style.titlecolor
.
.PP
.SS EVERTICAL
A vertical list of elements.
.PP
.SS MASK
When an element contains an Image 
.I object
, the 
.I Image.draw
function will be used to display it on the screen.
The mask 
.I image
is used as an argument to 
.I Image.draw
.
See 
.I Draw Module
in Chapter 11.
.PP
.SS R
All 
.I Elements
are rectangular, occupying the position on the display specified by 
.I r.min
.
The size of the element also depends on 
.I r
.
During creation, if the rectangle is degenerate (has zero size), the element takes its size from the sizes of its components.
For example, the image size for icons and text width for strings.
Otherwise, the element\[aq]s size matches the rectangle.
.PP
.SS TAG
The 
.I tag
of an element serves two purposes: it allows an element to be labeled with arbitrary invisible text, and it provides a mechanism to control which elements of a list may be selected.
The tag 
.I field
of an element may be modified freely after the element is created.
(See Compound.tagselect in 
.I prefab\-compound.
)
.PP
.SS ICON (ENV, R, ICON, MASK)
Build one EIcon 
.I element
to be drawn with the 
.I icon
and 
.I mask
.
The rectangle, 
.I r
, gives the element\[aq]s position and size.
.PP
.SS TEXT (ENV, TEXT, R, KIND)
Build a textual element or a list of textual elements.
The 
.I kind
parameter may be 
.I EText
or 
.I ETitle
, determining the style of the drawn 
.I text
.
The resulting 
.I Element
object may be a single element or a 
.I EVertical
list of the appropriate kind, if the text occupies more than one line.
The text is folded as necessary to accommodate the available horizontal space; newlines in the text cause line breaks.
The width of the text is determined by 
.I r
, but if 
.I r
has no width, it will be set by the text itself.
The height of the Element is also determined by 
.I r
.
If the height of 
.I r
is zero, the Element will be made as tall as necessary.
If 
.I r
is not tall enough, the rest of the text may be made visible by calls to 
.I Element.scroll
.
Thus one may choose a specific size or let the 
.I text
determine the size by setting 
.I r
suitably.
.PP
.SS LAYOUT (ENV, LAY, R, KIND)
Like 
.I Element.text
but builds a structure using the contents of the list of 
.I Layout
adts.
The 
.I Layout
adt allows construction of a more general form of textual display by providing fine control over the font and color in which to display text and the inclusion of images as textual elements.
It also allows setting of the 
.I tag
for each component of the resulting element or list of elements.
If the 
.I Layout
has a non\-nil 
.I image
field, it is taken as a description of a picture to be incorporated in the text as an 
.I EIcon
element (and the 
.I text
field is ignored); otherwise the 
.I text
field specifies the text to be drawn in the indicated 
.I font
and 
.I color
.
As with 
.I Element.text
, 
.I Element.layout
does all the geometry management, including text line breaking and folding.
.PP
.SS ELIST (ENV, ELEM, KIND)
Start a list of Element objects.
The 
.I kind
may be 
.I EHorizontal
or 
.I EVertical
, specifying the orientation of the list.
Parameter 
.I elem
will be the first element of the list.
It may be 
.I nil
, which creates an empty list of the requested orientation.
Subsequent 
.I Element.append
calls build the list.
.PP
.SS SEPARATOR (ENV, R, ICON, MASK)
Build one 
.I ESeparator
element to be drawn with the 
.I icon
and 
.I mask
.
The rectangle, 
.I r
, gives the element\[aq]s position and size.
.PP
.SS ELIST.APPEND (ELEM)
Append one 
.I Element
, 
.I elem
, to an existing list, 
.I elist
.
The new element will appear after those already there, either to the right for 
.I EHorizontal
or below for 
.I EVertical
lists.
.PP
.SS ELEM.ADJUST (SPACING, DIR)
Format the list so its elements abut.
The list\-building functions such as 
.I append
attempt to build a sensible geometry.
Alternatively, one can build a list using degenerate geometry and then let 
.I adjust
compute the geometry for the whole list.
For example, one could place all the elements at (0, 0) and then call 
.I adjust
to decide where the elements belong.
.PP
.SS SPACING
specifies how the elements fit together
.PP
Adjequal
.PP
Makes them all equal sized in the dimension of the list, but only as big as the largest element.
For example, if the element is a horizontal list, all elements will be as wide as the widest item.
If the list is too big for the allocated space, only some will be visible.
.PP
Adjfill
.PP
Makes them all of equal size in the dimension of the list, expanding the elements to fit the space of the list\[aq]s 
.I Element.r
.
If the list is too big for the allocated space, only some will be visible.
.PP
Adjpack
.PP
Packs elements as tightly as possible, using the default size of each element and setting their rectangles against one another.
.PP
.SS DIR
controls how each element is placed in its allotted space
.PP
Adjcenter
.PP
Place each element in the middle of its space.
.PP
Adjdown
.PP
In a vertical list, move each element to the bottom.
.PP
Adjleft
.PP
In a horizontal list, move each element to the left.
.PP
Adjright
.PP
In a horizontal list, move each element to the right.
.PP
Adjup
.PP
In a vertical list, move each element to the top.
.PP
.SS ELEM.CLIP(R)
The drawing model for 
.I Element
objects is that they occupy some space in the plane, which may be larger or smaller than the space occupied by its constituent text, icons, sub\-elements, and so on.
The 
.I clip
function sets the rectangle of 
.I elem
to 
.I r
, without changing its internal geometry.
Any space made newly visible by this will be filled in by the list\[aq]s 
.I Style.elemcolor
.
For example, if 
.I e
is an icon element just large enough to display its image, 
.I e.clip
(
.I e.r.inset
(\-
.I 2
)) will make a two\-pixel\-wide border around the icon when it is drawn.
As another example, lists are scrolled by leaving their clip rectangle intact while translating the list elements\[aq] coordinates.
.PP
.SS ELEM.SCROLL(D)
Argument 
.I d
is a 
.I Point
, representing a vector; 
.I elem
is an 
.I Element
to be scrolled.
The 
.I scroll
function leaves the element\[aq]s 
.I r
alone and translates all the constituent pieces of the list by 
.I d
, causing a different portion of 
.I elem
to be visible in its rectangle.
.PP
.SS ELEM.TRANSLATE(D)
Like 
.I elem.scroll
(
.I d
), but moves 
.I r
too, thus translating the entire 
.I Element
rather than just the visible part within a fixed rectangle.
.PP
.SS ELIST.SHOW(ELEM)
The 
.I show
function does nothing if 
.I elem
is not a list.
If it is a list, the list is scrolled so 
.I elem
, which must be a member of the list, is visible through 
.I elist.r
.
.PP
The geometry of elements and the membership of lists may be modified only through the provided functions.
The Limbo\-visible structure is intended to be read\-only.
Tags, text, and images may be modified freely by the application.
There is no way to recalculate the geometry if the components of an textual or image icon change size.
.PP

.I Element
objects are not drawn explicitly, and they are not drawn after any 
.I Element
operation.
They are made visible only by calls to 
.I Compound.draw
, described in 
.I compound \- windows for ITV toolkit
.
