.SH SERVER COMMAND
On a \[aq]signer\[aq] server, the 
.I getauthinfo
command provides an interactive means to create a certificate for a user.
The id is specified as the file name, 
.I default
.
Before issuing the getauthinfo command, a directory must exist on the server with the name 
.I /usr/inferno/keyring
.
.PP
.SH CLIENT COMMAND
On a client, the 
.I getauthinfo
command provides a means to obtain a user\[aq]s certificate from a \[aq]signer\[aq] server.
The 
.I id
is of the form 
.I net!machine
, where machine is the address of the \[aq]signer\[aq] server (see 
.I bind, mount, unmount \- change name space
for more information about addresses of this form).
.PP
In order to perform authentication, two machines must have a certificate from the same \[aq]signer\[aq] server.
To save a certificate in a file on a client, a directory 
.I /usr/username/keyring
must be created on the client, where 
.I username
is the name of the user for whom the certificate is to be obtained.
.PP
.SS USER RESPONSES
The user is prompted for the following items:
.PP

T}
T{

the name of the user for whom a certificate is either to be created on the server or retrieved on the client.

T}
T{
password
T}@T{
the password for the user.
The password entered on the client must match the password on the server in order to retrieve a certificate.

command (see changelogin earlier in this chapter).
The password must be at least 7 characters.
