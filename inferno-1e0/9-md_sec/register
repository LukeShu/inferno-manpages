.SH DESCRIPTION
The register command contacts a \[aq]signer\[aq] host and obtains an authenticated certificate based on the contents of /nvfs/ID (the set\-top\-box\-id in non\-volatile memory).
The certificate is deposited in file /nvfs/default for later use.
.PP
The \[aq]signer\[aq] host contacted is defined by signer, the first option to the command.
If missing, the \[aq]signer\[aq] defined by the /services/cs/db file is used.
.PP
There are several phases to obtaining the certificate:
.IP "1." 3
First, the register command interacts with the \[aq]signer daemon\[aq] (the thread listening on the infsigner port on the \[aq]signer\[aq] host) to construct the certificate.
This certificate is \[aq]blinded\[aq] by a random bit mask, sent back to the register command and displayed textually or graphically, as appropriate.
.IP "2." 3
The user running the register command must contact a human agent at the \[aq]signer\[aq] host by an independent, secure mechanism (for example, a telephone call).
The agent at the \[aq]signer\[aq] host there runs the verify command (see
.IR verify (9)
) to display the same \[aq]blinded\[aq] certificate being displayed to the user of register on the client.
Once the agent is convinced that the \[aq]blinded\[aq] certificate has been delivered to the correct party, the agent tells verify to accept the identify of the caller.
.IP "3." 3
The register command contacts the \[aq]countersigner\[aq] daemon (the thread listening on the infcsigner port of the \[aq]signer\[aq] host) to obtain the bitmask needed to \[aq]unblind\[aq] the previously received certificate.
This step can only be validly performed after the completion of the verify command on the \[aq]signer\[aq] host.
