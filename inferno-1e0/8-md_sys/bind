.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I bind
, 
.I mount,
and 
.I unmount
commands modify the file name space of the current process and its name space group.
For both calls, 
.I target
is the name of an existing file or directory in the current name space where the modification is to be made.
The name 
.I target
is evaluated as described in
.IR sh (5)
, except that no translation of the final path element is done.
.PP
.SS BIND (SOURCE, TARGET, FLAG)
For 
.I bind
, 
.I source
is the name of an existing file or directory in the current name space.
After a successful 
.I bind
call, the file name 
.I target
is an alias for the object originally named by 
.I source
.
If the modification doesn\[aq]t hide the original, 
.I source
will still refer to the original file.
The evaluation of 
.I source
happens at the time of the 
.I bind
, not when the binding is used.
.PP
.SS MOUNT (FD, TARGET, FLAG, ANAME)
The 
.I fd
argument to 
.I mount
is a file descriptor of an open pipe or network connection to a file server ready to receive Styx messages.
The target 
.I file
must be a directory.
After a successful 
.I mount
the file tree served by 
.I fd
will be visible with its root directory having name 
.I target
.
.PP
With 
.I mount
, the file descriptor 
.I fd
must be open for reading and writing and connected to a file server.
(See
.IR dial (8)
&.)
.PP
After the 
.I mount
, the file tree starting at 
.I target
is served by a kernel 
.I mnt
device.
That device will turn operations in the tree into messages on 
.I fd
.
.PP
The string 
.I aname
is currently unused.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS FOR BIND AND MOUNT
For both 
.I bind
and 
.I mount
, the 
.I flag
controls details of the modification made to the name space.
In the following descriptions, 
.I source
refers to the file as defined by 
.I name
or the root directory served by 
.I fd
.
Both 
.I target
and 
.I source
files must be directories, or both must non\-directories.
The 
.I flag
parameter can be one of the following:
.PP
.SS MREPL
Replace the target file by the source.
An evaluation of 
.I target
will be translated to the source file.
If they are directories 
.I target
becomes a 
.I union
directory consisting of one directory, the source file.
.PP
.SS MBEFORE
Both 
.I target
and 
.I source
must be directories.
Add the files of the 
.I source
directory to the union directory at 
.I target
so its contents appear first in the union.
After a 
.I bind
or 
.I mount
with this option, the source directory will be searched first when evaluating file names in the union directory.
.PP
.SS MAFTER
Like 
.I MBEFORE
but the source directory goes at the end of the union.
.PP
.SS MCREATE
The 
.I MCREATE
flag can be OR\[aq]ed with any of the flags previously described above.
When a 
.I create
call attempts to create in a union directory, and the file does not exist, the elements of the union are searched in order until one is found with 
.I MCREATE
set.
The file is created in that directory; if that attempt fails, the 
.I create
fails.
(see
.IR open (8)
)
.PP
.SS UNMOUNT (NAME, TARGET)
The effects of 
.I bind
and 
.I mount
can be undone by 
.I unmount
.
If 
.I name
is 
.I nil
, everything bound to or mounted on 
.I target
is unbound or unmounted.
If 
.I name
is not 
.I nil
, it is evaluated as described above for 
.I bind
, and the effect of binding or mounting that particular result on 
.I target
is undone.
.PP
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The return value is a positive integer (a unique sequence number) for success, \-1 for failure.
.PP
.SH CAVEAT
The 
.I mount
command will not return until it has successfully attached to the file server, so the thread doing a 
.I mount
cannot be the one serving.
