.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS STAT (NAME, D) AND FSTAT (FD, D)
Given a file\[aq]s 
.I name
, or an open file descriptor 
.I fd
, these routines return information about the file into the 
.I Dir
member of the returned tuple.
The 
.I int
member will be zero for success and \-1 for failure.
.PP
.SS WSTAT (NAME, D) AND FWSTAT (FD, D)
The wstat and 
.I fwstat
functions apply the file attributes of 
.I d
to the file.
Only certain attributes can be modified.
See the section 
.I Modifying File Attributes
.
Both functions return zero for success and \-1 for failure.
.PP
.SS THE DIR ABSTRACT DATA TYPE
File status is managed via the Dir abstract data type:
.IP

Qid: adt 
{   
    path:  int;   
    vers:  int; 
}; 

Dir: adt

    uid:    string;   
    gid:    string;   
    qid:    Qid;   
    mode:   int;   
    atime:  int;   
    mtime:  int;   
    length: int;   
    dtype:  int;   
    dev:    int;

.SH NOTES
The following behaviors apply when Inferno is hosted on Windows\-based systems.
.PP
.SS FAT FILE SYSTEM (WIN95 AND WINDOWS\-NT)
The values of 
.I uid
and 
.I gid
are 
.I Everyone
.
.PP
Files and directories always have read and execute permission.
They cannot be changed.
Files without write permission cannot be removed.
.PP
.SS NTFS FILE SYSTEM (WINDOWS\-NT)
Permissions for read, write, and execute operate as described above.
.PP
The 
.I uid
attribute is supported.
.PP
The 
.I gid
attribute is interpreted always to mean the special group 
.I InfernoGroup
, even if the underlying Windows system maintains other groups for the file.
Special group 
.I Everyone
is used to represent \[aq]other\[aq] for permissions.
