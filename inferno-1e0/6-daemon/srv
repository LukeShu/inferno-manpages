.SS INITIALIZATION
Prior to starting the daemons, the 
.I srv
command defines its name space according to the specification in file 
.I server/namespace
(relative to the current directory).
See
.IR newns (15)
for the specification format.
.PP
The 
.I srv
command also starts the connection service for resolving network addresses.
See
.IR cs (5)
command.
.PP
.SS FILE SERVICE
The 
.I srv
command spawns a thread that monitors requests on the 
.I styx
service port.
For each incoming request, yet another thread is spawned to authenticate the connection and provide access to the local file system.
See
.IR dial (8)
for the discussion of the 
.I export
function.
.PP
.SS REMOTE EXECUTION SERVICES
Among the daemons created by the 
.I srv
command is a thread that monitors requests on service port 
.I rstyx.
These requests represent requests by clients for commands to be executed on the server.
.PP
See
.IR rcmd (5)
for the description of a client interface for sending command requests to a server.
.PP
Each incoming request is logged to the server\[aq]s console.
The message includes the client\[aq]s network address.
.PP
The client\[aq]s request must consist of two lines:

The command and arguments, if any to be executed on the server.

.PP
The client\[aq]s commands are executed with the same Inferno user ID that was used when the 
.I srv
command was issued.
.PP
The client\[aq]s commands are executed on the server with standard input, output, and error redirected to the 
.I /dev/cons
device on the client.
This redirection requires that the client export its file system (see
.IR dial (8)
) over the connection it creates to the server.
.PP
.SS TERMINATION
Once the daemons have been started, the 
.I srv
command starts the Inferno shell (see
.IR sh (5)
) to process command line input.
The 
.I srv
command does not terminate.
