.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I virgild
daemon monitors requests for name service arriving on UDP port 
.I virgil
.
Those requests are translated into a network address via the local connection server (see
.IR cs (6)
) and sent back to the requesting client.
.PP
Requests should be of the form:
.PP

.I userid?machinename

.PP
The 
.I userid
field is currently unused but must be supplied to satisfy the required syntax.
The machine name can be a symbolic service name as described in
.IR db (A)
&.
Such names are resolved against the 
.I /services/cs/db
file on the machine running 
.I virgild
.
.PP
The request is included in the response format:
.PP

.I userid?machine_name=network_address

.PP
The 
.I virgild
daemon assumes that the local connection service has already been started.
.PP
.SH CAVEAT
If the machine name cannot be resolved into a network address, the virgild daemon writes a warning message to its standard error and reads its input for the next request.
No notification is sent to the client.
Clients are advised to arrange for a timeout on their translation requests.
.PP
The 
.I virgild
daemon is (currently) single threaded.
