.SH NAME
cs \- connection server daemon
.SH SYNOPSYS
cs 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The connection server daemon, 
.I cs
, is started by the 
.I cs
command.
The daemon monitors requests for interpretation of host names written by application programs to 
.I /net/cs
, the interface file.
After writing the request, the application reads that same file to obtain the response from the 
.I cs
daemon.
.PP
The current implementation uses the hosting system\[aq]s facilities for name\-to\-address and other conversions.
.PP
.SS REQUEST FORMAT
Requests must be strings in the form:
.IP
.EX
    net!machine!service
.EE
.PP
Each component of the request is required.
.PP
.SS NET
The 
.I net
component defines the network to be used (for example, 
.I tcp
, 
.I udp
).
The special value 
.I net
can be supplied to request the most expedient network.

.SS MACHINE
The machine component can be any of the following

T}
T{
symbolic server name of the form $server
T}@T{
Converted to hostname by reference to the connection server database file 
.I /services/cs/db
.
The hostname returned is then converted to an network address.
No machine name is converted.
Other conversions (for example, 
.I net
and named services) are still done.

.SS RESPONSE FORMAT
The application can obtain the converted address by reading the 
.I /net/cs
interface file.
The response will consist of two fields of the form:
.IP
.EX
    /net/net/clone          ipaddr!portno
.EE
.PP
The first field is the name of the file to open to reserve a connection on Inferno\[aq]s IP device.
The second field can be used to construct a 
.I connect
message for the 
.I ctl
file returned by the open of 
.I clone
.
.PP
.SH NOTE
The service name to port number conversion is controlled by a 
.I <services
> file.
The location of that file is platform dependent:

.SH CAVEATS
Applications that use a single file descriptor for both reading and writing should take care to reset the file offset to 0 between writing the request and reading the response.
Otherwise, a truncated response will be read.
Applications using buffered I/O should flush after resetting the offset.
.PP
Sometimes a hostname will resolve into several network addresses.
The connection server provides all.
Each read of 
.I /net/cs
delivers one.
The connection server caches this information until read; consequently, the application is obliged to read 
.I /net/cs
in a loop until the end\-of\-file condition is reached.
That means that all available addresses have been obtained and the daemon\[aq]s cache for this request is empty.
